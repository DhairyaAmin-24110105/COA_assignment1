### Q1 ###
### Ans ###
Using the file in the demo.c the computations were carried with N=1024, N=1500 and N=1800.
The results are as follows: 
Execution Time taken: -O0 (default) ---> N=1024 = 3.662090 seconds
                                         N=1500 = 10.726606 seconds
                                         N=1800 = 24.359762 seconds
